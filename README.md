# Bike-Sales-Analysis
This project analyzes bike sales data to determine the age and income range of customers who buy bikes the most. The data was gathered from a local bike shop in the United States over the course of a year.

Data
The data set contains information on 500 bike sales, including the age and income range of the customers who bought the bikes. The data was collected using Microsoft Excel and grouped according to the following columns:

Customer ID: A unique identifier for each customer.
Gender: The gender of the customer (Male/Female).
Age: The age of the customer.
Annual Income (k$): The annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
Spending Score (1-100): A score assigned to the customer based on their spending habits and purchasing data.
Marital Status: The marital status of the customer (Single/Married).
Occupation: The occupation of the customer.
Education: The highest level of education attained by the customer.
Home Owner: A binary indicator of whether the customer owns a home or not.

Analysis
Using Excel's pivot tables and charts, we analyzed the data to determine the age and income range of customers who buy bikes the most. We also looked at the total revenue generated by bike sales.

Results
Our analysis found that the majority of bike buyers were between the ages of 25 and 44, with the highest number of buyers in the 35-44 age range. The majority of buyers also had an income range of $25,000 to $75,000. Overall, the bike shop generated $250,000 in revenue from bike sales over the course of the year.

Conclusion
Based on our analysis, we recommend that the bike shop focus their marketing efforts on customers between the ages of 25 and 44 with an income range of $25,000 to $75,000. This will help to maximize their revenue from bike sales.

Future Work
In the future, we plan to gather more data on bike sales from other bike shops in the area to further validate our findings. We also plan to use machine learning techniques to make predictions about which customers are most likely to buy bikes based on their age and income range.
